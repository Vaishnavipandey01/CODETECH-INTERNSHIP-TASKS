#DESIGN A RESTFUL API FOR A LIBRARY OR INVENTORY SYSTEM
Designing a RESTful API for a Library or Inventory System involves creating endpoints for handling common actions like adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving information.
Below is a breakdown of how such an API could be structured, including typical resources, endpoints, HTTP methods, and sample request/response formats.
ASSUMPTIONS:
 • We are building an Inventory System(library, book collection, or any inventory system).
 • Resources include Books, Users, Transactions (for borrowing or purchasing items).
ASSUMPTIONS:
* The system will have Books as the main resource.
* Operations include adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving books.
* We will implement typical CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
* Filtering and pagination for book listings will also be included.
API RESOURCES:
BOOKS:Represent a book in the library.
* ATTRIBUTES:
  •id: Unique identifier for the book (integer).
  •title: Title of the book (string). 
  •author: Author of the book (string).
  •category: Genre or category of the book (string).     
  •quantity: Number of copies available (integer). 
  •published_date: Number of copies available (integer).
